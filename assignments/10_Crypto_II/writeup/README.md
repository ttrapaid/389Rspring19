### Part 2 (30 Pts)

1. What do you notice about both pictures?

    Both images appear to have been modified such that the original image is harder to make out. However, it is clear that the second image (cbc.bmp) is a better way to encrypt to image file. 

2. Which block cipher mode is less secure? Why? Explain using information about
   how the different block cipher modes of operation work.

   ECB mode is less secure. This appears to be because of the way the encryption works for this mode - the initial plaintext is sent through a block cipher encryption, as opposed to CBC mode, which uses an initialization vector before using the block cipher encryption.

*Your reflection goes here*
