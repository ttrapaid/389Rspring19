The first thing I did was use the nc command as described in the description for part 1. 
Then, when prompted to to enter a domain/IP address, I utilized command injection in order to 
take advantage of the vulnerablilities in v0idcache's server.
I entered: "1337bank.money; grep -R "CMSC" .", 
Which returned some information about the domain (output of DiG command), and then the output of the command
that I injected, which was: "./home/flag.txt:CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}" 

v0idcache should probably use a more secure web server framework, or at least add a couple layers to her server so that commands can't be injected so easily.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

In the writeup directory, you will find a python script "shell.py" that will run an 
interactive shell with the goal of imitating a regular terminal or unix shell. To start this shell, simply run "python shell.py" in a unix shell. There are four simple commands that you can run in this shell: 

    - help
    - shell
    - pull
    - quit

Help and quit are fairly elementary commands; help will display the four available commands as shown above and their descriptions; quit will end/quit program/shell. Pull and shell are more complex than the first two and as such are a little more code heavy (see shell.py). 

Both pull and shell take advantage of the vulnerability in v0idcache's web server by utilizing command injection. The pull command essentially downloads a file from v0idcache's server into a local path. Pull takes in two arguments: the first being a filepath to search for in v0idcache's server, and the second being a local filepath to download that file to. If the file that the filepath points to does not exist, then the file will be created with the name provided (i.e "~/test.txt"), however, providing a filepath with a directory that does not exist will fail. Shell, on the other hand, is a utility command that attempts to mimic a unix shell on v0idcache's server, as if you were actually logged in on their machine and launching a terminal from there.
