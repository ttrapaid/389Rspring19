## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 Pts)

CMSC389R-{y0u_ar3_th3_SQ1_ninj@}

### Part 2 (60 Pts)

Part 1: simply put "<script>alert();</script>" into the search bar.
Part 2: use img tag here instead of script, and onerror call the alert() function
Part 3: because the HTML uses quotes, add a quote and then the onerror call to the url 
Part 4: ')%3Balert(1)%3B('   -> have to use %3B instead of semicolon, wont recognize otherwise
Part 5: The URL for the sign up page has a link to a "confirm" page from the next button, just replace the confirm 
        with the javascript alert. 
Part 6: https://xss-game.appspot.com/level6/frame#htTps://www.google.com/jsapi?callback=alert
