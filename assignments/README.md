# Assignments Directory
## Overview
This directory will be used for distributing and submitting your homework assignments.

All assignment folders will contain a README file containing instructions for that assignment, as well as any extra information or stub code provided by us.

All assignment folders will also contain a /writeup sub-folder that will contain a README template for you to complete your homework on. You should edit this file directly, adding your writeup and/or homework answers. You should also upload all screenshots, code, and any other materials you used to complete the assignment, to this sub-folder.
