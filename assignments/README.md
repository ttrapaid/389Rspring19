# Assignments Directory

## Overview

This directory will be used for distributing and submitting your homework assignments. For instructions on how to setup your GitHub repository and push/pull assignments, checkout [this guide](../guides/git_instructions.md).

All assignment folders will contain a README file containing instructions for that assignment, as well as any extra information or stub code provided by us.

All assignment folders will also contain a /writeup sub-folder that will contain a README template for you to complete your homework on. **ou should edit this file directly**, adding your writeup and/or homework answers. You'll notice the file is a **.md** file; MarkDown is a very simple text-formatting language to learn and it's quite useful! You should also upload all screenshots, code, and any other materials you used to complete the assignment to this sub-folder, referencing them in your writeup.
